# Moffat Bay Lodge Reservation System
*CSD460-A311 Capstone in Software Development*  
<sub>Bellevue University 9-week project-based course</sub>

## Introduction
Welcome to the Moffat Bay Lodge Reservation System, a full-stack web application designed for the fictional Joviedsa Island Resort in Washington State’s San Juan Islands. This project simulates a real-world development scenario where our team was tasked with creating a secure, user-friendly, and visually appealing website for a newly built resort and marina.

The application allows visitors to explore the lodge, learn about island attractions, and make reservations through a streamlined booking process. Customers can browse all public pages without logging in, but must register for a free account to confirm a booking. The system securely stores user credentials and reservation details in a MySQL database, applying modern best practices for password validation and encryption.

## Key Features
- **Landing Page** – Modern marketing design to welcome guests.
- **About Us, Contact Us & Attractions** – Static HTML/CSS pages highlighting the lodge and island activities.
- **User Registration & Login** – Email-based authentication, password rules, and secure storage using hashing.
- **Vacation Booking** – Select room size, guest count, and check-in/check-out dates.
- **Reservation Summary & Confirmation** – Review and confirm bookings, with cancellation and submission options.
- **Reservation Lookup** – Search previous reservations by ID or email.
